This code defines several classes and functions related to storing and manipulating chat message history. The TimedChatMessage class extends the ChatMessage class and adds a timestamp attribute. The TimedChatMessageHistory class extends the BaseChatMessageHistory class and adds methods for adding user and AI messages to the chat history, clearing the history, loading the chat history from a file, and applying the chat history to a ConversationTokenBufferMemory object. The code also includes two utility functions for converting TimedChatMessage objects to and from dictionaries with ISO-formatted timestamps. Finally, there are some commented-out lines of code demonstrating how to use the TimedChatMessageHistory class.
