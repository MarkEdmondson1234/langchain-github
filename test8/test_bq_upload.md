This code defines a unit test for the `upload_to_bigquery` function in the `bq_upload` module. It imports the `unittest` module and the `patch` and `MagicMock` classes from the `unittest.mock` module. The `TestBigQuery` class extends `unittest.TestCase` and defines a `test_upload_json` method that tests the `upload_to_bigquery` function. The method uses the `patch` decorator to mock the `open`, `json.loads`, and `google.cloud.bigquery.Client` functions. It then sets up mock objects and calls the `upload_to_bigquery` function with a sample JSON file. Finally, it checks that the necessary functions were called using the `assert_called_once_with` method. The code also includes a comment with an example of how to use the `unittest` module to test the `upload_to_bigquery` function.
