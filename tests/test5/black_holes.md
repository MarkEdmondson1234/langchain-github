This code defines a function called 'compute_evaporation_time' that calculates the time it would take for an object with a given mass to evaporate due to Hawking radiation. The function uses the mass of the object to calculate the evaporation time using the formula t = 5120 * pi * G**2 * mass**3 / (hbar * c**4), where G is the gravitational constant, hbar is the reduced Planck constant, and c is the speed of light. The function returns the evaporation time in years. The 'if __name__ == '__main__'' block initializes the mass of the Earth and calls the 'compute_evaporation_time' function, printing the result to the console.
