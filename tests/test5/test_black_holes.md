This code defines a unit test for a Python script that calculates the evaporation time of a black hole with a given mass due to Hawking radiation. The 'TestBlackHoles' class contains a single test function, 'test_earth_mass', which initializes the mass of a black hole with the same mass as the Earth and checks that the evaporation time calculated by the 'compute_evaporation_time' function from the 'black_holes' module is equal to the expected value. The 'if __name__ == '__main__'' block runs the unit test when the script is executed.
