This code sets up an OpenAI chat model and uses it to generate responses to prompts. It imports several modules, including os, my_llm, and langchain. The code sets up an OpenAI API key and initializes a ChatOpenAI object with a temperature of 0.4. It also initializes a memory object with the namespace "debugger" and clears it. The code then generates a response to the prompt "How many ways are there to travel between the north pole and Copenhagen directly?" using the request_llm function from my_llm. It prints the response and generates a second response to a prompt that asks for a Danish translation of the first response. Finally, the code applies a summarization function to the memory object and prints the resulting summary. The memory object is then saved to a vector store.
