This code defines a unit test for a Python script that generates a list of prime numbers up to 1000 and returns the sum of the first 100 primes in the list. The 'TestPrimeNumbers' class contains a single test function, 'test_sum_of_first_100_prime_numbers', which calls the 'sum_of_first_100_prime_numbers' function from the 'prime_numbers' module and checks that the result is equal to 24133. The 'if __name__ == '__main__'' block runs the unit test when the script is executed.
