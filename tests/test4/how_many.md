This code calculates the number of days between Alan Turing's birth date (June 23, 1912) and a list of test dates. The code initializes a birth date and a list of test dates, and uses a for loop to iterate over the test dates and calculate the number of days between each test date and the birth date. The number of days is printed to the console in a formatted string.
