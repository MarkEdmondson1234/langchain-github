This code is a Python script that generates Python code using OpenAI's language model. It takes in a prompt string and an output file path as arguments, and optionally a test file path. If a test file path is not provided, the script will attempt to generate one and pause for the user to inspect it.

The code sets up the OpenAI API and defines a chat model and a conversation buffer window memory. It also defines a function to parse the generated code and extract the code and any feedback from the AI.

The main workflow of the code involves requesting code generation from the OpenAI API using the prompt string and the test file, if provided. If the generated code fails the test, the script will request updated code and retry the tests up to three times.

Here's an example of how to use this code:

1. Save the code in a file called create_script.py
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the create_script.py file.
3. Run the command `python create_script.py "Write a Python script that calculates the sum of the first 100 prime numbers" my_script.py --test_file my_test.py` to generate a Python script called my_script.py that calculates the sum of the first 100 prime numbers and passes the tests in my_test.py.
