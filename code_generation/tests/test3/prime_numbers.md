This code defines a function called 'sum_of_first_100_prime_numbers' that generates a list of prime numbers and returns the sum of the first 100 primes in the list. The function initializes a list of the first two prime numbers, and then uses a while loop to generate additional prime numbers until there are 100 primes in the list. The function checks each odd number greater than 3 to see if it is prime by iterating over all numbers from 2 to the number itself, and checking if any of them divide the number evenly. If the number is not divisible by any of the numbers in the range, it is added to the list of prime numbers. Finally, the function returns the sum of the first 100 primes in the list.
