Hello! I'm happy to help summarise code. Yes, the code examples are always enclosed with three backticks (```). To summarise the code, we import various modules and define several functions. The `get_repo_docs` function gets Markdown documents from a repository, while `get_source_chunks` gets source chunks. We also have `parse_code` which extracts code from the OpenAI API response, and `generate_code_summary` which summarises code using the OpenAI API. The `main` function loads a QA chain and retrieves answers based on user input. Is there anything else you would like me to explain?
