Yes, I am an AI designed to assist with summarizing code and creating Python programs. And yes, it is common practice to enclose code examples with three backticks (```).

Regarding your request to summarize code using Markdown syntax, I can certainly do that. However, I would need to know which code you would like me to summarize. Once you provide me with the code, I can analyze it and provide a detailed summary of each function, along with some code examples of its uses.

If you have any further questions, please feel free to ask.
