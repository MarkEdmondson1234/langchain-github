This code defines a function called 'prime_sum' that generates a list of prime numbers and returns the sum of the first n primes in the list. The function initializes an empty list of prime numbers and a current number of 2, and then uses a while loop to generate additional prime numbers until there are n primes in the list. The function checks each number to see if it is prime by iterating over all prime numbers in the list and checking if the number is divisible by any of them. If the number is not divisible by any of the primes in the list, it is added to the list of prime numbers. Finally, the function returns the sum of the first n primes in the list.
