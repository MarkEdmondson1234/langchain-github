I'm sorry to hear that the code didn't pass the test. The error message indicates that there is a syntax error in the code. Specifically, the line `I'm sorry to hear that the code didn't pass the test. The error message indicates that there is a syntax error in the code. Specifically, the line `pip install google-cloud-bigquery` is not valid Python code and is causing a syntax error. You should remove this line from your code and install the `google-cloud-bigquery` module using pip in your terminal or command prompt. Once you have installed the module, you can try running the code again and see if it passes the test. Let me know if you have any further questions or issues!
