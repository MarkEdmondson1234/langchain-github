This code imports the unittest module and the prime_sum function from a module called prime_numbers. It then defines a test class called TestPrimeNumberFunctions that inherits from the unittest.TestCase class.

Within the TestPrimeNumberFunctions class, there is a test method called test_sum_of_first_100_prime_numbers. This method uses the assertEqual() method to check that the output of the prime_sum() function is equal to the expected value of 24133.

Finally, the code checks if the __name__ variable is equal to '__main__', which means that the script is being run directly and not imported as a module. If this is the case, the unittest.main() function is called to run all the tests in the TestPrimeNumberFunctions class.

Here's an example of how to use this code to run the tests:

1. Save the code in a file called test_prime_numbers.py
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the test_prime_numbers.py file.
3. Run the command `python test_prime_numbers.py` to run the tests.
