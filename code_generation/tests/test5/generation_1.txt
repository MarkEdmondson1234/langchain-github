Great! To compute the evaporation time of a black hole via Hawking radiation, we can use the following formula:

t = 5120 * pi * G^2 * M^3 / (hbar * c^4)

where t is the evaporation time in seconds, pi is the mathematical constant, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, hbar is the reduced Planck constant, and c is the speed of light.

To convert the evaporation time from seconds to years, we can divide it by the number of seconds in a year (which is 3.154e+7).

Here's an example Python code that computes the evaporation time of a black hole with the same mass as the Earth:
