This code defines a test case using the Python unittest module to test the "compute_evaporation_time" function from a separate module called "black_holes". The test case includes a single test that checks if the function correctly calculates the evaporation time for a black hole with the same mass as the Earth. The expected result is provided as a constant, and the "assertAlmostEqual" method is used to compare the actual result from the function to the expected result with a tolerance of 7 decimal places. The code also includes a main block that runs the test case using the "unittest.main()" method. An example usage of the code would be to add more test cases to the "TestBlackHoles" class to check other mass values.
