This code defines a function called "sum_of_first_100_prime_numbers" that calculates the sum of the first 100 prime numbers. The function starts with a list of the first two prime numbers (2 and 3) and then uses a while loop to continue adding prime numbers to the list until it has 100 numbers. The code checks if each number is prime by using a for loop to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. If the number is not divisible by any other number, it is added to the list of prime numbers. Finally, the sum of the first 100 prime numbers is returned. An example usage of the code would be to call the function and print the result: "print(sum_of_first_100_prime_numbers())".
