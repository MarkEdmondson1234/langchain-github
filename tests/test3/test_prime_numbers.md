This code imports the "unittest" and "prime_numbers" modules and defines a test case for the "sum_of_first_100_prime_numbers" function in the "prime_numbers" module. The test case checks if the result of calling the function is equal to the expected value of 24133. The "unittest.main()" function is called to run the test case. An example usage of the code would be to run the test case by executing the script: "python test_prime_numbers.py".
