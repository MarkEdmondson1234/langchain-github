This code imports the "unittest" module and the "prime_sum" function from a file called "prime_numbers". It defines a test class called "TestPrimeNumberFunctions" that inherits from "unittest.TestCase". The class contains two test methods that check if the "prime_sum" function returns the correct sum for the first 100 and 10 prime numbers, respectively. The code then runs the tests using the "unittest.main()" method. An example usage of the code would be to run the file in the terminal: "python test_prime_numbers.py".
