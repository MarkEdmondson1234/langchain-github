This code defines a function called 'create_gcp_cloud_build_yaml' that generates a YAML file for Google Cloud Build. The function takes in three arguments: the path to a Dockerfile, the name of the image to be built, and the ID of the Google Cloud project. The function creates a list of steps for the build process, which includes running the Docker build command with the specified image name and path to the Dockerfile. The function also creates a list of images to be pushed to the Google Cloud Container Registry. The function then creates a dictionary containing the steps and images lists, and uses the 'yaml' library to dump the dictionary into a YAML-formatted string. The YAML string is returned by the function.
