This code defines a unit test for a Python script that generates a list of prime numbers and returns the sum of the first n primes in the list. The 'TestPrimeNumberFunctions' class contains two test functions, 'test_sum_of_first_100_prime_numbers' and 'test_sum_of_first_10_prime_numbers', which call the 'prime_sum' function from the 'prime_numbers' module and check that the result is equal to the expected value. The 'if __name__ == '__main__'' block runs the unit test when the script is executed.
