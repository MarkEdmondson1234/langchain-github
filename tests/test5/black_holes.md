This code defines a function called "compute_evaporation_time" that calculates the evaporation time of a mass using the given formula. The function takes in a parameter called "mass" and uses constants such as the gravitational constant, reduced Planck constant, speed of light, and pi to calculate the evaporation time in seconds. It then converts the result to years and returns it. The code also includes a main block that sets the mass of the Earth and prints the result of calling the "compute_evaporation_time" function with that mass. An example usage of the code would be to call the function with a different mass value: "print(compute_evaporation_time(1e+20))".
