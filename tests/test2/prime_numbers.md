This code defines a function called "prime_sum" that takes an integer argument "n" and returns the sum of the first "n" prime numbers. The function uses a while loop to generate prime numbers and adds them to a list until the list has "n" elements. It checks if each number is prime by dividing it by all previously generated prime numbers. An example usage of the code would be to call the function with an argument of 5: "prime_sum(5)".
