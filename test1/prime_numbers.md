This code defines a function called prime_sum() that generates a list of prime numbers between 2 and 1000 and returns the sum of the first 100 primes in that list.

The function starts by creating an empty list called prime_list. It then iterates through all numbers between 2 and 1000 using a for loop. For each number, it checks if it is prime by using the all() function with a generator expression that checks if the number is divisible by any integer between 2 and the number itself. If the number is prime, it is added to the prime_list using the append() method.

Finally, the function returns the sum of the first 100 primes in the prime_list using slicing notation [:100].

Here's an example of how to use the function:

1. To generate the sum of the first 100 prime numbers between 2 and 1000, you could call the prime_sum() function like this:
`prime_sum = prime_sum()`
`print(prime_sum)`
