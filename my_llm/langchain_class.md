This code imports various modules related to natural language processing and machine learning, including langchain, google.cloud, and pydantic. It defines a TimedChatMessage class that inherits from ChatMessage and adds a timestamp and metadata field. The code also includes functions for memory, document storage, text splitting, and vector storage, among others. The purpose of this script is likely to create a chatbot or conversational AI system. However, without more information about how these functions are used and how they relate to each other, it is difficult to provide a more detailed summary.

This code defines a class called PubSubChatMessageHistory that inherits from BaseChatMessageHistory. The purpose of this class is to manage chat message history and publish chat messages to a Google Pub/Sub topic. The class includes several methods for setting memory paths, getting memory vector stores, writing data to disk, and publishing data to Pub/Sub. The inputs and outputs for each function are described in the comments within the code.

This code defines several functions for managing chat message history and publishing chat messages to a Google Pub/Sub topic. The functions include adding user, AI, and system messages, clearing the message history, printing messages, and loading newline JSON messages from a file. The inputs and outputs for each function are described in the comments within the code.

The inputs and outputs for each function are described in the comments within the code. The specific function you asked about, _process_chatgpt_json, takes a JSON string as input and returns a list of TimedChatMessage objects that represent chat messages processed from the input JSON. It does this by parsing the JSON, extracting the relevant message data, and creating TimedChatMessage objects for each message. The function also writes the messages to disk and publishes them to a Google Pub/Sub topic if those options are enabled.
