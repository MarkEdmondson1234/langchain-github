This code defines a unit test for a Python script that uploads JSON data to Google BigQuery. The 'TestBigQuery' class contains a single test function, 'test_upload_json', which mocks the necessary functions and checks that the correct functions are called with the expected arguments. The 'setUp' function can be used to set up the test environment if necessary. The 'if __name__ == '__main__'' block runs the unit test when the script is executed.
