This code is a Python script that sets up the OpenAI API and defines several functions for requesting and parsing code generation from the API. The functions include "init_memory", "parse_code", "reset_totals", "request_llm", "request_code", and "save_to_file". The functions are related in that they all contribute to the process of generating and handling code from the OpenAI API. The inputs and outputs for each function are described within the code. If a function does not have any inputs or outputs, it is specified within the function definition.
